  - Jenkins Master server,Puppetmaster  
  - Testing Server
  - Production server
'------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puppet:
- Puppet Modules - init.pp - created to install required softwares on new servers
- manifests site.pp 
- status.txt
example : Git,Docker,Java,maven

Source code - Github
  - Followed Gitflow workflow approach
  - Master Branch  - production code
  - Develop Branch - Testing code

Jenkins Job
Build Pipeline has been created for Build,Test and Deploy

 - Job1 :Build_Website - Source code is bild on jenkins and ready for testing [Code is copied to jenkins workspace]
 - Job2 :Testing Website - Test the built website
      - if code is pushed on Develop branch - Testing will be done on Testing server and it will not be pushed to production
      - if the testing is successfull - it will deploy on docker container
Testing: Selenium script has created with maven build tool , pom.xxml - exported as .jar file to run on linux server [ test2.jar ]
        - It runs in Headless mode [  chromiumbrowser,chromedriver on linux host]
        
      - if code is pushed on Master branch - tetsing will be done and next job will be trigerred
      - if the testing is successfull - it will run Push to production jenkins job
 - Job3 :Push To production - Website will be deployed on production server using docker container
 '-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Docker file:
 - download docker container - apache [ which will install apache2 service on our container]
 - deploy our website on docker container and create docker image
 - push it to docker hub
 
Code - Index.html,images folder
pom.xml - used in selenium-maven project
Dockerfile - Create docker container,deploy code on container, create docker image,push to docker hub

 Puppet configuration management tool - Install software on slave nodes/servers - Artifacts\ init.pp,site.pp,status.txt
 test.jar - selenium maven code - used to run for testing - java -jar test.jar
 test.sh - verifies the putput of Testing job and move to next job in pipeline based on the pass status of Testing job
